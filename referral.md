title: Referral Policy
---

Since I am getting several requests for a referral and the number of annual referrals is limited, I have decided to impose the following policy. 

Please only DM me for a referral if you can get **4 points or above** based on the following list:

- (3 points) I know you personally, i.e., we have interacted outside of LinkedIn.
- (3 points) You have an *exceptional* achievement, e.g., a gold medal at IPhO or a finalist at ACM-ICPC.
- (2 points) You have a publication in a top-tier conference (e.g., NeurIPS, ICML, ACL, etc.) or a journal.
- (2 points) You have a significant industry experience (e.g., Google, Microsoft, Meta, etc.).
- (1 point) You have an undergraduate degree from a top school (e.g., IITs, BITS, etc.) with high GPA, or are in the process of getting one.
- (1 point) You have a graduate degree from a top school (e.g. see [CSRankings](https://csrankings.org/#/index?all&us)) with high GPA, or are in the process of getting one.
- (1 point) The position you are applying for is based in the US.
- (1 point) The position you are applying for is in the field of speech/NLP, deep learning, or related.

When you DM me, please specify the points you are claiming and provide evidence for each point. I hope you understand that I have to be selective in order to maintain the quality of referrals.
