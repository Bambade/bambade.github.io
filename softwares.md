Here are some open-source projects to which I contributed:
<br />

- **[ProxSuite](https://github.com/Simple-Robotics/proxsuite)** 
    ProxSuite is a header only open-source C++ library that integrates the ProxQP quadratic programming solver and the QPLayer differentiable layer, which I developed during my PhD. It is available on [conda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/proxsuite) and [pip](https://pypi.org/project/proxsuite/), and is included in [CVXPY](https://www.cvxpy.org/version/1.4/install/index.html). My main contributions involved designing and implementing both solvers as part of my doctoral research. The library integrates python and julia bindings, and can be used with pytorch.
- **[Aligator](https://github.com/Simple-Robotics/aligator)** 
    I contributed to the algorithmic design of Aligator, a flexible, open-source library for real-time robotics trajectory optimization. Aligator supports motion generation, planning, optimal estimation, and deploying model-predictive control for complex systems.
- **[Proxsuite-nlp](https://github.com/Simple-Robotics/proxsuite-nlp)** 
    Proxsuite-nlp extends the ProxQP algorithm to nonlinear optimization on manifolds, serving as a key component of the Aligator solver. I had the opportunity to contribute to its development as well.
