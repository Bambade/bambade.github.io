<br>I am a third-year PhD student at <a href="https://www.cs.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins University</a>, working in the <a href="https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/">Center for Language and Speech Processing (CLSP)</a>, advised by <a href="https://clsp.wse.jhu.edu/faculty-pages/sanjeev/">Sanjeev Khudanpur</a> and <a href="http://www.danielpovey.com/">Dan Povey</a>. My research interests lie in the application of machine learning methods for speech and language tasks. I am currently working on <b>speech recognition</b> and <b>speaker diarization</b> in real, far-field, overlapping speech scenarios.<br><br>

I graduated from IIT Guwahati in 2017 with a major in Computer Science. My bachelor thesis was on deep learning methods for relation extraction in clinical text, supervised by <a href="http://www.iitg.ac.in/anand.ashish/index.html">Ashish Anand</a>.<br><br>

When I’m not doing ML, I like to work out, climb boulders, play guitar, and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/62772844-desh-raj?shelf=read&sort=date_read">read fiction</a>.<br>

	<li><i>June 2020:</i> I am participating in <a href="https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/speech-recognition-and-diarization-for-unsegmented-multi-talker-recordings-with-speaker-overlaps/">JSALT 2020</a>. I will be working on informed target speaker ASR with <a href="http://www.kecl.ntt.co.jp/icl/signal/member/marcd/">Marc Delcroix</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/shinjiwatanabe">Shinji Watanabe</a>.</li><br>

	<li><i>May 2020:</i> Our JHU submission to the <a href="https://chimechallenge.github.io/chime6/results.html">CHiME-6 challenge</a> obtained second-best results in Track 2 (diarization + ASR track). The system description paper is available <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07898">here</a>.</li><br>
