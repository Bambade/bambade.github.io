<br>I am a PhD student at <a href="https://www.cs.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins University</a>, working in the <a
	href="https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/">Center for Language and Speech Processing (CLSP)</a>, advised by <a
	href="https://clsp.wse.jhu.edu/faculty-pages/sanjeev/">Sanjeev Khudanpur</a> and <a
	href="http://www.danielpovey.com/">Dan Povey</a>. My research interests lie in the application of machine learning
methods for speech and language tasks. I am currently working on <b>speech recognition</b> and <b>speaker
	diarization</b> for multi-talker recordings. I am generously funded by an <a
	href="https://ai2ai.engineering.jhu.edu/2022-2023-ai2ai-fellows/">AI2AI fellowship</a> for 2022-23.<br><br>

I have interned in the speech groups at Microsoft (in 2021) and Meta (in 2022). Previously,
I graduated from IIT Guwahati in 2017 with a major in Computer Science.<br><br>

<!--  My bachelor thesis was on deep learning methods
for relation extraction in clinical text, supervised by <a href="http://www.iitg.ac.in/anand.ashish/index.html">Ashish
	Anand</a>.<br><br> -->

When I’m not doing ML, I like to work out, climb boulders, play guitar, and <a

<b>Updates:</b><br><br>

<ul>
	<li><i>February 2023:</i> <b>2 papers</b> accepted at <a href="https://2023.ieeeicassp.org/">IEEE ICASSP 2023</a>.
		These papers investigate target-speaker ASR using transducers (work done at Meta AI), and using self-supervised
		models (led by my colleague <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iQ-S0fQAAAAJ&hl=en">Zili
			Huang</a>).
	</li><br>

	<li><i>October 2022:</i> I am selected as a recipient for the inaugural JHU+Amazon <a
			href="https://ai2ai.engineering.jhu.edu/2022-2023-ai2ai-fellows/">AI2AI fellowship</a> for 2022-23.
	</li><br>

	<li><i>May 2022:</i> I passed my GBO (JHU CS qualifying exam) and officially became a Ph.D. candidate (<a
			href="./static/ppt/gbo_presentation.pdf">here</a> are
		the slides for my presentation). Also,
		I'll be starting an internship at Meta AI (Menlo Park) in the Speech team.
	</li><br>

	<li><i>January 2022:</i> <b>2 papers</b> accepted at <a href="https://2022.ieeeicassp.org/">IEEE ICASSP 2022</a>.
		These papers investigate multi-talker ASR with neural transducers, and adding domain knowledge for
		fine-tuning of large self-supervised models. <a href="./static/pdf/clsp_recruitment_poster.pdf">Here</a> is a
		poster describing both papers.
	</li><br>

	<li><i>Janurary 2022:</i> I participated in the Mini SCALE workshop organized by HLTCOE. I was in the
		<b>"Improving speech analytics for room audio"</b> team led by <a href="https://m-wiesner.github.io/">Matthew
			Wiesner</a>.
