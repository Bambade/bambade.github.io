<br>I am a Research Scientist in the Optimization Department of EDF Lab Paris-Saclay, where I develop and refine advanced numerical solvers tailored for energy management applications. 
Our team tailors diverse optimization methodologies based on problem structure, with solutions encompassing mixed-integer, continuous, stochastic, distributed optimization, and machine learning methods.<br><br>

Previously, I was a PhD student at <a href="https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-de-paris">Inria</a> and <a href="https://www.ens.psl.eu">ENS</a> Paris, 
specializing in numerical optimization and machine learning applied to real-time robotics. My PhD research was conducted within the 
<a href="https://www.inria.fr/en/willow">Willow</a> and 
<a href="https://www.di.ens.fr/sierra/">Sierra</a> teams and under the supervision of
<a href="https://jcarpent.github.io/">Justin Carpentier</a>, 
<a href="https://adrientaylor.github.io/">Adrien Taylor</a> and 
<a href="https://www.di.ens.fr/~ponce/">Jean Ponce</a>. 

During my PhD, I notably developed the open-source <a href=https://github.com/Simple-Robotics/proxsuite>ProxSuite library</a>,
which integrates the ProxQP quadratic programming solver, and the QPLayer differentiable layer. <br><br>
